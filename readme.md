# UMBRELLA 

This repository contains the Umbrella Dashboard, a tool designed specifically for the ZGT hospital infrastructure. The dashboard is powered by a back-end that automatically retrieves and updates data every week through the CastorEDC API. This ensures that the information remains current without manual intervention.

The front-end is built using the R Shiny library, providing an interactive and user-friendly interface. It can be deployed on Shinyproxy for seamless integration within the ZGT environment.

Please note that the dashboard has been tailored for ZGTâ€™s specific setup, so certain queries or design elements may not be transferable to other healthcare settings. While it can serve as a reference, adjustments may be required for use in different infrastructures. 


## Usage
1. Change the back_end/config.R and front_end/config.yml files with the right credentials.    
2. Docker the applications or run them without containerization. Some filepaths might need to be altered depending on your R working direcotry
3. If containerized: Start the Dockers, the Shiny Docker can be deployed on shinyproxy
